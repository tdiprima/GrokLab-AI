## **Roles in a Chat-Based AI System**

1. **System Role ("system")** – Sets the AI's **behavior, rules, and personality**. This message helps guide the assistant on **how** to respond but does not appear in the conversation.
   
2. **User Role ("user")** – Represents the **user's input** (questions, commands, prompts). This is what the assistant is responding to.

3. **Assistant Role ("assistant")** – Represents the AI's **response** to the user. It's the **output** of the AI.
