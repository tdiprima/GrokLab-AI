From openai_compatibility_check.py:

Cats always land on their feet because they're secretly practicing for the feline Olympics. They've got the "gravity-defying fluff" technique down to a science! But seriously, it's due to their incredible sense of balance and a reflex called the "righting reflex," which helps them twist their bodies mid-air to land on their feet. Just don't tell them it's not magic; they might get a bit...paws-itive about it!
