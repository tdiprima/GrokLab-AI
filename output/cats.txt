Cats always land on their feet because they're secretly practicing for the feline Olympics. They've got the "gravity-defying fluff" technique down to a science! But seriously, it's due to their incredible sense of balance and a reflex called the "righting reflex," which helps them twist their bodies mid-air to land on their feet. Just don't tell them it's not magic; they might get a bit...paws-itive about it!

But let's be real, if cats had a motto, it would be: "I meant to do that." Even when they don't land perfectly, they'll strut away like they just pulled off the coolest stunt ever. That's the feline confidence we all aspire to! ðŸ˜¸
