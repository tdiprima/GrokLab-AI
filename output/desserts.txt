From desserts.sh:

Well, bless your heart, darlin'! A typical Southern dessert that's just as sweet as can be is pecan pie. It's made with a rich, gooey fillin' and topped with those crunchy pecans. It's a real treat, y'all! Of course, we also love our banana pudding, sweet tea cake, and don't forget about those delicious peach cobblers. Y'all come back now, ya hear?
