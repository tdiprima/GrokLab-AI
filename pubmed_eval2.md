Summary for a 10th Grader:<br>
The article <mark>**(it's a book; not an article)**</mark> talks about Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), which is a type of depression that affects a lot of people. It's not just feeling sad; it's a serious illness that can make it hard for someone to enjoy life or even do daily tasks. 

The article explains that MDD is caused by a mix of things, like genes (what you inherit from your family), changes in the brain, and things happening in someone's life, like stress or trauma. It also says that MDD can show up differently in different people. Some might feel very tired and sad, while others might feel more anxious or have trouble sleeping.

The good news is that there are treatments that can help. The article mentions that medicine and talking to a therapist can make a big difference. It also talks about newer treatments, like using magnets to help the brain or even changing someone's gut bacteria with special diets or pills.

The article stresses that it's important to understand MDD better so we can help people feel better. It also says that it's okay to ask for help if you're feeling depressed because there are people and treatments out there that can help.
