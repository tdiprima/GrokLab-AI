## Grok 2
I tested the **Grok API** (grok-2; no grok-3 thru the API yet) with the prompt: "Find a recent PubMed article on Major Depression. Summarize it in a way a 10th grader can understand. List references." Here's what I found:  

- **Results**: It sometimes hallucinated articles, and sometimes found real ones.  It got it right 50% of the time.  References/citations were hit-or-missâ€”correct at times, wrong or incomplete others. It's not super reliable yet.  
- **Performance**: Average response time was 8.39 seconds.  
- **Usage Stats**: Got token details, e.g., Prompt Tokens: 37, Completion Tokens: 595, Total Tokens: 632, with breakdowns like {'text\_tokens': 37, 'audio\_tokens': 0, 'image\_tokens': 0, 'cached\_tokens': 0}.  

## Grok 3
Then I asked **Grok3 online** (I did not use DeepSearch).  It came up with a real article.  But when it came to the citations, instead of saying "Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments..." it said "Canadian Network for Mood ***_bastards_*** Anxiety Treatments".  Weird!  I said "List references and citations" and it only listed the citation.

Any time I tried this, it gets actual articles 100% of the time.

**Claude (3.7 Sonnet) cannot access, search for, or retrieve specific articles.**  So&mdash;it can tell us *about* certain things, but it can't give us the article it came from.

I don't have the ability to browse the internet or access real-time information. However, I can provide you with general information and answer questions based on the knowledge and data programmed into me.

"Do you have the ability to query the internet?"  
I'm sorry, but currently I don't have access to the internet. Perhaps in the near future I'll have internet access to better serve you~
