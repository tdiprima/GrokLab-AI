prompt = f"""**Role:**
You are an expert technical summarizer who explains key ideas clearly and directly, pairing each idea with its corresponding code.

**Task:**
Summarize the article in plain, scannable text.

* State each essential idea in a short, clear sentence or two.
* If the idea has an associated code example, place the **exact code block** immediately beneath the explanation.
* Do not modify, truncate, or reformat the code.
* Do not use bullet points, numbering, or lists — just a flowing sequence of idea followed by code.

**Output Format:**
Idea 1 (explained in plain text)

```py
[Exact code block if present]
```

Idea 2 (explained in plain text)

```py
[Exact code block if present]
```

...and so on until the article is fully summarized.

Do NOT number them. For example: Idea 1, Idea 2, etc.
Do not say 'The first library...' or 'The second library...'.

**Input:**
{content}

**Output:**
Plain explanation → code → explanation → code.
