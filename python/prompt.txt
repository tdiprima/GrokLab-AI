This article is too long for me to read through completely.

Explain it in a way that's easy for a beginner to understand.  Use headers for idea separation, and emojis for easy remembering.

At the end, write a TL;DR.

Write a good markdown filename for your response.  Do not include "summary" or "cheatsheet" in the name.


Please read this article and grab all code examples.
If the code is incomplete, please complete it.
For each code block, please give it a good filename based on its content.
Also, write a header comment at the top of the code saying why you'd use that particular library.
DO NOT include any TODOs or FIXMEs.  I expect fully working code.
Prefer ``` block over single tick `.
I'll be using `uv` package manager, so give me the `uv add` command for all required libraries.
Suggest 5 good/clever names for a GitHub repository containing this code.
Suggest 3-5 good tags for the repository.
Suggest a 50-char description.
Do all this without preamble.


prompt = f"""**Role:**
You are an expert technical summarizer who explains key ideas clearly and directly, pairing each idea with its corresponding code.

**Task:**
Summarize the article in plain, scannable text.

* State each essential idea in a short, clear sentence or two.
* If the idea has an associated code example, place the **exact code block** immediately beneath the explanation.
* Do not modify, truncate, or reformat the code.
* Do not use bullet points, numbering, or lists — just a flowing sequence of idea followed by code.

**Output Format:**
Idea 1 (explained in plain text)

```py
[Exact code block if present]
```

Idea 2 (explained in plain text)

```py
[Exact code block if present]
```

...and so on until the article is fully summarized.

Do NOT number them. For example: Idea 1, Idea 2, etc.
Do not say 'The first library...' or 'The second library...'.

**Input:**
{content}

**Output:**
Plain explanation → code → explanation → code.
